# hangman

A command line based [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) game made with ruby. 

## Instructions

The program selects a random 5-12 letter word from [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt) list. The user can then choose to guess a letter, a word, or save the game. The next time they play they can load a saved game and pick up where they left off.

## Reflection

This was my first time playing with I/O, Files, and JSON in Ruby. I think that due to my focus on this I disregarded some OOP concepts, but overall I am relatively happy with how it came out.
